# USCDiarLibri #

We created the USCDiarLibri dataset that can be used to test speaker diarization tasks with various customized setups and randomization. USCLibriDiar dataset is based on artificial multi-party dialogs made from noisy, reverberated audio from the LibriSpeech database and it’s highly parameterized to allow for di-
verse conditions.
