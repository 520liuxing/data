We created the USCDiarLibri dataset that can be used to test speaker diarization tasks with various customized setups and randomization. The creation protocol is open-source and available to the public from
our website http://scuba.usc.edu. It is based on artificial multi-party dialogs made from noisy, reverberated audio from the LibriSpeech database and itâ€™s highly parameterized to allow for di-
verse conditions. In this paper we describe the small part of the corpus used for the study, USCDiarLibri2,4, while a more extensive description of the USCDiarLibri corpus is in preparation and will
also be on our git repo.
